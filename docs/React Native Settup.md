✅ Setting up the React App (Vite + Tailwind)

✅ Frontend Testing (Jest-based)

✅ Matches your project's structure (Keyhole-Solution-App for frontend)

📘 React App Setup & Testing Guide
⚙️ Setting Up the React Frontend
Our frontend is built using Vite with React and Tailwind CSS. The project resides in:

bash
Copy
Edit
/Keyhole_Automation_Platform/frontend
✅ Installation Steps
Navigate to the frontend directory:

bash
Copy
Edit
cd frontend
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy
Edit
npm install
Run the development server:

bash
Copy
Edit
npm run dev
Build for production:

bash
Copy
Edit
npm run build
Preview production build:

bash
Copy
Edit
npm run preview
🧪 Frontend Testing Strategy
We use Jest with React Testing Library for unit testing the React components.

🗂 Test File Structure
All tests for the React app live under:

bash
Copy
Edit
/Keyhole_Automation_Platform/Keyhole-Solution-App/tests
Tests mirror the source structure from frontend/src. For example:

Component Source	Test Location
frontend/src/components/Chatbot.jsx	Keyhole-Solution-App/tests/components/Chatbot.test.jsx
frontend/src/utils/helpers.ts	Keyhole-Solution-App/tests/utils/helpers.test.ts
✅ Running Tests
From the frontend directory:

bash
Copy
Edit
npm test
Or to run with watch mode:

bash
Copy
Edit
npm run test:watch
If test:watch is not set, add it in package.json:

json
Copy
Edit
"scripts": {
  "test": "jest",
  "test:watch": "jest --watch"
}
🧪 Jest Configuration
Jest config is located in:

arduino
Copy
Edit
/frontend/jest.config.js
We use:

jsdom as test environment

@testing-library/react for component testing

Support for .jsx, .tsx, .ts, .js

🧼 Best Practices
Tests live outside the source code, grouped in Keyhole-Solution-App/tests.

Every component should have at least one unit test.

Use mocking for API calls or global stores.

Let me know if you want me to generate a starter jest.config.js or create an example test case in your structure.

    cd frontend
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. **Run the development server**:
    ```bash

5. **Preview the production build**:
    ```bash
    npm run preview
    ```

## 🧪 React Testing Setup

We use **Jest** along with **React Testing Library** for unit testing React components.

🧪 Test files live outside the source code under:

/Keyhole_Automation_Platform/Keyhole-Solution-App/tests

yaml

This allows for centralized testing and easier batch testing across all frontend modules.

### 📁 Test Folder Structure

Test files mirror the structure of your `frontend/src` directory.

| Component Source                          | Test Location                                          |
|------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| `frontend/src/components/Chatbot.jsx`    | `Keyhole-Solution-App/tests/components/Chatbot.test.jsx` |
| `frontend/src/utils/helpers.ts`          | `Keyhole-Solution-App/tests/utils/helpers.test.ts`       |

---

### ✅ Running Tests

From inside the `frontend` directory:

```bash
npm test
To run tests in watch mode:

bash
Copy
Edit
npm run test:watch
If test:watch isn't already set up, add it in your package.json:

json
Copy
Edit
"scripts": {
  "test": "jest",
  "test:watch": "jest --watch"
}
⚙️ Jest Configuration
The Jest config file is located at:

arduino
Copy
Edit
/frontend/jest.config.js
We use:

jsdom as the test environment

@testing-library/react for component-level testing

TypeScript support for .ts / .tsx files

Aliased imports and babel-jest for JSX handling (optional depending on your setup)

✅ Best Practices
🧪 Keep test files outside the source tree in Keyhole-Solution-App/tests.

🧪 Every component or logic module should have a matching test file.

📦 Use mocking for API services, global stores, or environment dependencies.

🎯 Aim for unit and integration coverage, especially for form logic, API calls, and rendering.

🔧 Need help scaffolding tests or generating the Jest config? Just ask.

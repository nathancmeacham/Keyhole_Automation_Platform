# Testing Infrastructure and Setup

This document outlines the process and milestones completed to set up a robust testing environment for the **Keyhole Automation Platform** backend using `pytest` and related tools.

---

## ✅ Goals

- Ensure all backend test files are discoverable and executable via `pytest`
- Align test file structure to mirror the source code structure
- Validate that core systems such as the Qdrant vector DB and FastAPI backend are functional

## 🧪 Test Configuration

### `pytest.ini`

```ini
# Keyhole_Automation_Platform/pytest.ini
[pytest]
minversion = 6.0
addopts = -ra -q
testpaths = 
    tests
pythonpath = 
    backend/mcp/src
    backend
```

### `init_project.py`

Ensures that the memory system and Qdrant integration initialize before any code is executed.

```python
# Keyhole_Automation_Platform/init_project.py
import os
import sys

PROJECT_ROOT = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))
BACKEND_PATH = os.path.join(PROJECT_ROOT, "backend")

if BACKEND_PATH not in sys.path:
    sys.path.insert(0, BACKEND_PATH)

from memory_manager import init_memory_collection
init_memory_collection()

print("✅ Project initialized. All modules are now importable.")
```

---

## ✅ Test Results

Tests are now executable using the standard command:

```bash
pytest
```

All 7 backend tests passed successfully:

```
7 passed, 1 warning in 1.23s
```

> ⚠️ Warning noted from Pydantic v2 migration guide — safe to ignore for now.

---

## 🔄 Current Best Practices

- All test files reside in the `tests/` directory
- Test structure mirrors source code layout
- All testable modules import cleanly using `pytest.ini`-defined `pythonpath`
- Qdrant container must be running for memory-based tests to pass

---

## 📦 Coming Up Next

- Frontend test integration with React Native / Jest
- GitHub CI/CD test runs
- Test coverage reports via `pytest-cov`
- Mocking external APIs (Vonage, Gmail, WhatsApp, etc.) for unit tests

---

> 🧠 We now have a stable and clean test framework that validates all backend functionality including memory, routing, and system health. Time to build on this.
